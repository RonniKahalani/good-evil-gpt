# The GooDevil Chat
This JavaScript app enables a conversation with two different personalities (Goodness and Evilness).

Each personality has its own ChatGPT system prompt (role/context).

If the system supports synthesis speech, the chat responses are spoken in a voice, configured via the Voices dialog.

This is one of several OpenAI ChatGPT example apps. See also [ChatGPT Jokes App](https://github.com/RonniKahalani/chatgpt-jokes).
